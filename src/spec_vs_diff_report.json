  "summary": "REQ-1 is partially evidenced: a new dialog modal component exists to show the full ticket message with preserved line breaks and scrolling, and AdminQuoteFormsSection wiring for selecting a ticket/message view is present. However, the AdminQuoteFormsSection diff is truncated, so it cannot be fully verified that the table provides a working explicit interaction (e.g., click/view action) and that the truncated preview is no longer the only way to access the content, nor that the existing Mark Complete/Pending action remains unaffected.",

      "requirement": "In Quote Forms (frontend/src/components/AdminQuoteFormsSection.tsx), the message preview in the table is no longer the only way to access the content (currently truncated via `line-clamp-2`), and an explicit interaction exists to open a full-message view for any ticket without interfering with Mark Complete / Mark Pending.",
      "reason": "Although a FullTicketMessageModal was added and AdminQuoteFormsSection includes state/handler for viewing a message, the AdminQuoteFormsSection change is truncated and does not show the actual table cell/action UI (e.g., removing/keeping `line-clamp-2`, adding a 'View full' button/click handler), nor does it show the Mark Complete/Pending action section to confirm it is unchanged and non-interfering.",
