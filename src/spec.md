# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update homepage copy and layout so “Track Package” becomes “Track Order” everywhere, and the Track section appears below the Free Quote form (which should sit directly under Pricing).

**Planned changes:**
- Rename all user-facing occurrences of “Track Package” to “Track Order” across header navigation (desktop/mobile), hero CTA, footer quick link, and Track section text (e.g., “Track Your Order” and related copy updated to use “Order” instead of “Package” where appropriate).
- Reorder homepage sections to: Hero -> Pricing -> Get Your Free Quote (Request a Quote form) -> Track Order -> Footer.
- Ensure header/footer navigation and hero CTAs still smooth-scroll to the correct sections after the reorder.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see “Track Order” throughout the site, the quote form appears directly beneath Pricing, and navigation links still scroll to the moved Track Order and quote sections correctly.
