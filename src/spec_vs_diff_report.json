  "summary": "The diff does not show the requested logo asset being added/overwritten at the required public path. Instead, it only modifies metadata/summary files, while describing additional UI/style changes (colors, logo sizing, object-fit) that were not requested and conflict with the stated non-goals.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add the user-uploaded logo image file to the frontend static assets so it is served at the exact path `/assets/generated/blaines-card-clinic-logo.dim_512x512.png` (i.e., place/overwrite the file at `frontend/public/assets/generated/blaines-card-clinic-logo.dim_512x512.png`) without modifying the image content.",
      "reason": "The diff reports no added files (Added: 0) and only shows modifications to `frontend-file-summaries.txt` and `project_state.json`. There is no actual file diff evidence that `frontend/public/assets/generated/blaines-card-clinic-logo.dim_512x512.png` was added/overwritten in the repo.",

      "reason": "Changing logo sizing/fit behavior is listed as a non-goal unless required to address the missing-image issue; the request focuses on fixing the missing asset at the referenced path, not altering rendering behavior.",
