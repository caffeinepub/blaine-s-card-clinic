  "summary": "REQ-10 is largely implemented by wrapping header and footer logos in a new square container utility (.logo-square) with object-fit: contain and by keeping the existing logo asset path. However, the BuildRequest also calls for cropping/resizing the actual logo image to remove padding/tab-like artifacts, and there is no evidence in the diff summary of any asset/image modification.",

      "requirement": "Crop/resize the existing logo image (same filename/path) to a clean true square and remove any extra padding/expanded area that makes it look like header tabs are part of the image.",
      "reason": "The diff shows only CSS/layout changes for rendering the logo in a square container; no static asset change is shown for /assets/generated/blaines-card-clinic-logo.dim_512x512.png, and no image file modifications are listed.",
