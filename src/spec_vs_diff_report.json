However, the diff summary does not provide evidence that the required password modal/validation flow is implemented, nor that an admin-protected backend endpoint exists to list quote/quote-form tickets for an admin “Quotes” view.",

      "requirement": "Hide the admin panel UI by default and only reveal it after the user clicks an \"Admin\" quick link and successfully enters the password \"PonytaPower17!\" (including modal prompt, exact password check, error message on failure, scroll-to-admin on success, and not persisting unlock across refresh).",
      "reason": "The provided diff summary does not include changes to the header/admin panel rendering or any password prompt/modal implementation or password verification logic.
